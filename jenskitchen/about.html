  <h1>About Jen's Kitchen</h1>

  <p>The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. Bon Appetit!</p>

  <p>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.</p>

  <p>If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:jen@example.com">jen@example.com</a>. Call me at: <a href="tel:+62111122223333">+62 1111 2222 3333</a></p>
